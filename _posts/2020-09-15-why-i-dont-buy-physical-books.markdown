Some people could say I had too many books. Some would say... not nearly enough. But with four plastic tubs full of books, it was safe to say that I *definitely* had too many books. And nothing makes you more aware of this fact than having to shlep them from one new place to another. Books are heavy. Books are inconvenient. Books can be an utter pain in the ass to move. And after a particularly awful move last year, I decided to finally liquidate my physical library of books.

## Why I resisted eBooks
I resisted eBooks for the longest time. I've loved the concept of being able to take your entire library in your purse but I've had serious concerns that, even now, I'm not entirely satisfied are resolved. Concerns such as "ownership" of eBooks, the prevalence of DRM on eBooks, and the lack of consumer rights vis-Ã -vis eBooks. These are still valid concerns that need to be addressed. Tragically, they haven't been addressed yet. I feel that governments around the world need to rise to the challenge and create strong laws protecting consumer rights to eBooks.

## So, does that mean I have a Kindle?
No. For three major reasons.

Firstly, Jeff Bezos and Amazon are legitimately creepy. [Manually removing copies of 1984 and Animal Farm from people's Kindles after purchasing them](https://www.theregister.com/2009/07/18/amazon_removes_1984_from_kindle/) is deeply disturbing. Not to mention, I've been banned from Amazon before and the idea that a full library of books that I purchased could be denied to me is deeply troubling.

Secondly, I had a Kindle before and it broke like a promise. I haven't found a way to protect Kindles from accidental damage, whether that accidental damage was from a drop or just from travelling in a purse. Kindles are fragile souls and, quite honestly, I'm not thrilled about that fact.

Thirdly, I read a lot of manga and I'd like a device that not only handles my regular books but also my manga collection.

Being ingrained in the Apple ecosystem, I got myself an iPad Pro last month and I gotta say, this is a real game changer. I've been using it for a month for a variety of things but I've been planning to get one for a class at my synagogue to handle some of the readings. And while some of the books (Finding God and A History of the Jewish Experience) aren't available on the Apple Bookstore just yet, some (Living a Jewish Life and Jewish Literacy) are. And based on reading the book "Dreadnought" by April Daniels over the last week, I feel that the reading experience isn't too different from reading a physical book. Though, it is nice to have a bigger library in my hands and in my bag.

## So, what now?
Previously, I had my physical library catalogued and available for others to peruse at [https://library.vero.moe](https://library.vero.moe). However, I feel that it's time that I move the old library here to archive.vero.moe and start cataloguing my new, digital library based on what I actually have.
